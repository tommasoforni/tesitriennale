# tesitriennale

My thesis for the bachelor's degree in Physics I obtained in 2016. I used [SpDust](http://pages.jh.edu/~yalihai1/spdust/spdust.html) to calculate the anomalous emission of interstellar dust in various interstellar environments and studied the influence of the environments parameters on the spectra.
